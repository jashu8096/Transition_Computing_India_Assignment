Checklist System: 
The Checklist System is a Node.js-based application designed to evaluate specific conditions (rules) against input data fetched from an external API. The results of these evaluations (Passed/Failed) are displayed on a user-friendly dashboard. The system is modular, making it easy to add, remove, or modify rules as required.

Core Features
Dynamic Data Fetching:

Uses an API to fetch application data.
Supports dynamic rule evaluations based on the retrieved data.
Condition Evaluation:

Implements multiple checklist rules to evaluate the data.
Each rule produces a "Passed" or "Failed" result.
Dashboard Display:

Displays the rule statuses in a clean, readable format.
Provides an overview of which rules are passing or failing.
Modular Rule Design:

Rules are stored in a configuration file.
Each rule is evaluated independently, promoting scalability and flexibility.
Error Handling:

Handles cases where the API is unreachable or returns invalid data.
Provides feedback to the user when evaluation fails due to missing or incorrect input.
How It Works
Data Fetching:

The system fetches application data from an external API using the provided URL.
Data is parsed and passed to the checklist evaluation module.
Rule Evaluation:

Rules are stored in an array of objects, with each object containing:
The rule’s name (a string describing the rule).
A condition function that checks whether the data satisfies the rule.
Each rule is executed dynamically using the input data.
Dashboard Rendering:

Results of the evaluation are rendered using an EJS (or similar) template engine.
The frontend displays a list of all rules with their respective statuses.
Example Checklist Rules
The system can handle various types of rules. For example:

Valuation Fee Paid:

Condition: isValuationFeePaid must be true.
Evaluation: Checks if the isValuationFeePaid property in the data is true.
UK Resident:

Condition: isUkResident must be true.
Evaluation: Ensures the applicant is a UK resident.
Risk Rating Medium:

Condition: riskRating must equal "Medium".
Evaluation: Compares the riskRating property to the string "Medium".
LTV Below 60%:

Condition: Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio must be below 60%.
Evaluation: Calculates LTV as (Loan Required / Purchase Price) * 100 and checks if the result is less than 60%.
How to Add New Rules
The system is designed for easy rule addition. To add a new rule:

Open the rules.js file.
Add a new rule object with a descriptive name and a condition function.
javascript
Copy code
{
  name: "New Rule Name",
  condition: (data) => {
    // Add your logic here
    return true; // Return true if the condition is met, false otherwise
  },
}
Save the file. The new rule will automatically appear in the checklist.
Example Dashboard Output
Rule	Status
Valuation Fee Paid	Passed
UK Resident	Passed
Risk Rating Medium	Passed
LTV Below 60%	Failed

Styling: CSS for dashboard presentation


Conclusion
The Checklist System is a flexible and scalable project designed to evaluate conditions dynamically and display results in a user-friendly format. Its modular design makes it ideal for real-world use cases where rules and data sources frequently change.
